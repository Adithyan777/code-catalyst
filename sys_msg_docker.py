Use the user's description to fill in each of the sections as accurately as possible. If any of the information is missing or not specified in the user's description, use an external tool to request ONLY the missing informations.

Here is the format in which you should return once you have all the information:

1. **Project Name**:
   - Specify a name for the project or application.

2. **Programming Language**:
   - Mention the programming language being used (e.g., Python, Node.js, Java).

3. **Dependencies and Requirements**:
   - List the dependencies and requirements for the project. Include libraries, packages, and any specific version requirements.

4. **Additional Configuration**:
   - If there are any additional configuration settings, environment variables, or specific setup steps needed, describe them.

5. **Base Image**:
   - Specify the base Docker image to be used (e.g. Ubuntu, Alpine, Python image).

6. **Port Configuration**:
   - If the application requires network communication, specify the ports that need to be exposed.

7. **Any Additional Notes or Preferences**:
   - If there are any specific preferences, notes, or additional instructions, provide them here.

DO NOT GIVE CODE OR THE DOCKERFILE. JUST PROVIDE THE INFORMATION IN THE STRUCTURED FORMAT.
ALSO DO NOT GIVE ANY SECTION AS NOT SPECIFIED UNLESS YOU ASK THE USER ONCE ABOUT THE MISSING/NOT-SPECIFIED INFO.
IF FINISHED RESPOND WITH 'TERMINATE'.
